# Application

We simulate some data now.
We want to work with stock market data -- we simulate three different stock prices for each single day in 2019.
All follow a normal distribution and are somewhat correlated.

```{r}
set.seed(06072020)
stock_data <- data.frame(
  time = as.Date("2019-01-01") + 0:364,
  x = rnorm(365, 15, 2)
)
stock_data$y = rnorm(365, 0.25 * stock_data$x + 15, 3)
stock_data$z = rnorm(365, 0.3 * stock_data$x + 20, 4)
```

a) Create a new `data.frame` which collapses the data so that it looks like the following (or similar).
(Of course all the information of `stock_data` should also be in the new `data.frame`).
Make use of the `tidyr` package.

```{r}
data.frame(
  time = rep("2019-01-01", 3),
  stock = c("x", "y", "z"),
  price = c(stock_data$x[1:3])
)
```

b) Try to produce the same data set using the `reshape2` package.

c) According to Hadley Wickham (the author of R4DS) why is your new data set tidy?

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

d) Find the function from the `tidyr` package that reverts the previously constructed tidy data to `stock_data`.

e) Use the `dplyr` package to group the data by week and compute their mean.
Use `ggplot2` to plot the weekly stock prices __nicely__.

[`OpenML`](https://www.openml.org/) is an inclusive movement to build an open, organized, online ecosystem for machine learning. 
They facilitate a great environment for open machine learning.
For machine learning, one typically needs data.
For now, we use `OpenML` as a data warehouse.
At later points in your study, you might come back here for a different purpose.

a) Get the data set we want to work with from `OpenML`: 
https://www.openml.org/d/41021

Read the data description (in fact the data is very interesting).
Download it as `.csv` and load it into `R`.
Store the data in your repository and make sure that using your code we can replicate your results.
(In fact this is very important: In the Take-home exam we also expect this from you and if this does not work you will score 0 on the problem.)

b) The data is messy.
Some types are not correct (e.g. character instead of numeric, no factors).
Correct the types.
Hint: For some columns like `Year` you could use both, factors or numerics.

c) There is missing data in the data set.
Use the `dplyr` package to fill all the missing values with the mean of the respective column.
For which columns may this be problematic?

You can hand in this problem set by the 6th of July to receive feedback.
